# Traktor Autoplaylist
Turn your Traktor playlists into smart, auto-updating ones.
This Java program checks for new music and adds them to your playlists automatically based on some rules (genre, BPM, key, etc.), by editing Traktor's collection.nml.

## How to use:
Download traktor-autoplaylist.jar and double click.
On first run, it will ask you where collection.nml is. It's usually somewhere in your Documents folder.
Click on playlists and edit rules. Then click "Start" to sort your tracks.
Traktor will automatically run.
