# Traktor Autoplaylist
Turn your Traktor playlists into smart, auto-updating ones.
This Java program checks for new music and adds them to your playlists automatically based on some rules (genre, BPM, key, etc.), by editing Traktor's collection.nml.

## How to use:
1. Download traktor-autoplaylist.jar and double click.  
2. On first run, it will ask you where collection.nml is. It's usually somewhere in your Documents folder.  
3. Click on playlists and edit rules. Then click "Start" to sort your tracks.  
4. Traktor will automatically run. (Tip: replace your Traktor shortcut with this one)

## Known bugs/Things to improve:
- Playlists cannot have the same names
- Completely untested on Windows
- Cannot detect if you removed a playlist in traktor
- It scans and sort the entire file every time
